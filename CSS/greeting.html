                <div>"Dear Dad,
                From my very first steps to every milestone I’ve reached, you've been my guide, my protector, and my greatest teacher. You shaped my childhood with love, led me through my education with wisdom, and kept me grounded with your values and strength.

                Every lesson you taught—spoken or shown—has made me who I am today. Thank you for never giving up on me, for standing by me, and for always showing me the right path.

                You're not just my father—you’re the foundation of my life. I’m forever grateful.
                With love,
                Your [son]"</div>

    <p>Animals move in pursuit of food, mates, or refuge from predators, and this movement attracts attention and interest, particularly as it becomes apparent that the behaviour of some creatures is not so very different from human behaviour. Other than out of simple curiosity, humans study animals to learn about themselves, who are a very recent product of the evolution of animals.</p>

    <h2>The animal kingdom</h2>

    <p>Animals evolved from unicellular eukaryotes. The presence of a nuclear membrane in eukaryotes permits separation of the two phases of protein synthesis: transcription (copying) of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the nucleus and translation (decoding) of the message into protein in the cytoplasm. Compared to the structure of the bacterial cell, this gives greater control over which proteins are produced. Such control permits specialization of cells, each with identical DNA but with the ability to control finely which genes successfully send copies into the cytoplasm. Tissues and organs can thus evolve. The semirigid cell walls found in plants and fungi, which constrain the shape and hence the diversity of possible cell types, are absent in animals. If they were present, nerve and muscle cells, the focal point of animal mobility, would not be possible.</p>
